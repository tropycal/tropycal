By default, this reads in the HURDAT dataset from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) website, unless you specify a local file path using either ``atlantic_url`` for the North Atlantic basin on ``pacific_url`` for the East & Central Pacific basin.\n\nHURDAT data is not available for the current year. To include the latest data up through today, the \"include_btk\" flag needs to be set to True, which reads in preliminary best track data from the NHC website. For this example, we'll set this to False.\n\nLet's create an instance of a TrackDataset object, which will store the North Atlantic HURDAT2 dataset in memory. Once we have this we can use its methods for various types of analyses.\n\n"
