======================
Realtime Functionality
======================
This sample script shows how to use Tropycal to retrieve and plot real time tropical cyclones and potential formation. As this script was written on 15 June 2022, the data below is valid for the time this script was written.

Reading In Realtime Dataset
---------------------------

Let's start with the Realtime dataset by loading it into memory. By default, this reads in Best Track data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and filters for all active tropical cyclones and invests over the last 18 hours.

The default is to not include global storms in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)'s area of responsibility. To read in invests and storms within JTWC's domain, add a ``jtwc=True`` argument, followed by a ``jtwc_source`` argument which can be either "jtwc", "noaa", or "ucar". Read through the documentation to see the limits and pros/cons of each method.

To keep this demonstration simple, we'll solely focus on the North Atlantic basin.

View Current Activity
---------------------

To quickly view the content of the Realtime object, we can simply print it:

    Active Invests:

Alternatively, we can also list all active storms, along with an optional filter by basin.

A new functionality with Tropycal v0.4 is to plot a summary of all ongoing activity, whether globally or by basin. This function can be highly customized, with more details in the documentation.

At the time this script was written, Hurricane Blas is active in the eastern Pacific Ocean, with East Pacific invest 93E (60% of development) and Atlantic invest 93L (30% of development).

The domain option for this plot is set to 'all' by default, plotting the full globe. This can also be a basin (e.g., 'north_atlantic', 'east_pacific'), or a custom domain, as we'll plot below.

Let's look at a few ways to customize this plot. There are four properties available to customize the plot, detailed more thoroughly in the documentation:

- ``two_prop`` - Properties to customize NHC Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) plotting
- ``invest_prop`` - Properties to customize invest plotting
- ``storm_prop`` - Properties to customize tropical cyclone plotting
- ``cone_prop`` - Properties to customize forecast cone/track plotting

The above plot includes the NHC TWO by default. Plotting the TWO overrides any invests that have a TWO associated with them (invests that are outside of NHC's area of responsibility or don't have a TWO still appear). We can pass the ``'plot':False`` argument to any property dict, which in doing so removes that element from the summary map. Let's test this out by removing the TWO and cone of uncertainty from the plot:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-56

.. code-block:: default


    realtime_obj.plot_summary(domain={'w':-130,'e':-60,'s':5,'n':50}, two_prop={'plot':False}, cone_prop={'plot':False})

Realtime Storms
---------------
To retrieve a storm from a Realtime object, simply use its ``get_storm()`` method and provide an ID as listed in ``list_active_storms()``:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-63

.. code-block:: default


    storm = realtime_obj.get_storm('EP022022')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-67

This now returns a RealtimeStorm object. RealtimeStorm objects inherit the same functionality as Storm objects, but have additional functions unique to realtime storms. Additionally, as these can also be valid for invests, certain functionality that is only available for tropical cyclones (e.g., NHC forecasts or discussions) is unavailable for invests.

Let's view what this RealtimeStorm object contains:

A quick and easy way to check if a storm is an invest is by checking its ``invest`` attribute. This will let you know if you can use the full set of functionality available for tropical cyclones or not.

The next few blocks will overview functions unique to RealtimeStorm objects. We can easily retrieve the latest available forecast dictionary from NHC or JTWC, depending on what area of responsibility the storm is in.

This function also calculates the forecast Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), derived by combining its observed ACE through the current time plus the forecast ACE using linearly interpolated forecast sustained wind.

In \nfact, several SSMIS microwave passes indicate that Blas is \ndeveloping an inner core, with at least a banding mid-level eye \nfeature showing up on the 89-GHz channel. The latest 1200 UTC \nsubjective Dvorak estimates were T3.5/55 kt from TAFB and T4.0/65 kt \nfrom SAB. In addition, the most recent objective Dvorak estimates \nfrom UW-CIMSS have been quickly increasing with the latest estimate \nat T4.3/72 kt. A blend of the aforementioned data yields 65 kt for \nthe advisory initial intensity, making Blas a hurricane.\n \nThe center of Blas may have relocated a bit further south into the \nlarge overnight convective burst, but its mean motion this morning \nhas continued a pronounced left turn, estimated at 290/4 kt. A \ncontinued west-northwest motion with some acceleration is \nanticipated over the next several days as the mid-level ridge \npoleward of the storm continues to build in and extend westward \nahead of Blas. Towards the end of the forecast, Blas is expected to \nbecome a shallow system, resulting in a slowing westward motion as \nthe low-level flow exerts greater influence. The latest forecast \ntrack has been adjusted a bit south in the short-term based on the \nadjusted initial position , but ends up just north of the previous \nforecast by the end of the period, close to the center of the track \nguidance envelope.\n \nThe most recent microwave images suggest that Blas is developing an \ninner core, which would likely support further intensification today \nas the system remains over warm (28-29 C) sea surface temperatures \n(SSTs) embedded in sufficently high mid-level moisture. A possible \ncomplicating factor is that both the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS \nguidance indicates easterly shear increasing to 20-25 kt over \nthe next 24-36 h. Assuming this does not play a major inhibiting \nfactor, the latest NHC forecast indicates continued intensification \nand peaks Blas as category 2 hurricane in 24 h. After 36 h, Blas \nwill be crossing a sharp SST gradient, moving over sub 26 C waters \nby 60 h. For this reason, weakening is anticipated to begin by \nFriday. At the end of the forecast period, Blas is likely to lose \nits deep-convective activity and become a shallow low-level vortex.\n \nWhile Blas is expected to remain off the coast of Mexico, its\nassociated swells are expected to affect portions of the coast of\nsouthwestern Mexico beginning today and continuing through the end\nof the week.\n \n \nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\n \nINIT  15/1500Z 14.9N 102.8W   65 KT  75 MPH\n 12H  16/0000Z 15.3N 103.5W   75 KT  85 MPH\n 24H  16/1200Z 15.8N 104.8W   85 KT 100 MPH\n 36H  17/0000Z 16.5N 106.6W   80 KT  90 MPH\n 48H  17/1200Z 17.1N 108.3W   75 KT  85 MPH\n 60H  18/0000Z 17.7N 110.0W   65 KT  75 MPH\n 72H  18/1200Z 18.2N 111.6W   55 KT  65 MPH\n 96H  19/1200Z 18.8N 114.1W   40 KT  45 MPH\n120H  20/1200Z 19.0N 116.5W   30 KT  35 MPH\n \n$$\nForecaster Papin\n \nNNNN\n'}

Lastly, RealtimeStorms also provide the latest available information using the ``get_realtime_info()`` method.

The default argument is ``source='all'``, which returns the latest available data whether from Best Track or NHC Public Advisories. Other possible values are "public_advisory", which only returns the latest public advisory, or "best_track", which only returns the latest best track data.
