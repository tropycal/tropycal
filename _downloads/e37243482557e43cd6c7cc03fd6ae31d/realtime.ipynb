By default, this reads in Best Track data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and filters for all active tropical cyclones and invests over the last 18 hours.\n\nThe default is to not include global storms in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)'s area of responsibility. To read in invests and storms within JTWC's domain, add a ``jtwc=True`` argument, followed by a ``jtwc_source`` argument which can be either \"jtwc\", \"noaa\", or \"ucar\". Read through the documentation to see the limits and pros/cons of each method.\n\nTo keep this demonstration simple, we'll solely focus on the North Atlantic basin.\n\n"
