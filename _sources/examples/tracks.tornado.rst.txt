=========================
Tornado Analyses
=========================
This sample script illustrates how to retrieve and analyze the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) tornado database (1950-present), using both the tornado and tracks modules.

For documentation generation purposes, return_ax must be set True for plotting functions. You don't need to have this extra argument in every plotting function call (e.g., "storm.plot(return_ax=True)" will produce the same output as "storm.plot()").


.. code-block:: default


    import tropycal.tracks as tracks
    import tropycal.tornado as tornado
    import datetime as dt








Using TornadoDataset
--------------------
Let's start by creating an instance of a TornadoDataset object. By default, this reads in the SPC tornado database from their website.


.. code-block:: default


    tor_data = tornado.TornadoDataset()
    




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    --> Starting to read in tornado track data
    --> Completed reading in tornado data for 1950-2018 (8.67 seconds)




We can use a TornadoDataset object to analyze both tornadoes associated with tropical cyclones and non-TC tornadoes. As an example of the latter, we can make a plot of all tornadoes during the 27 April 2011 tornado outbreak, along with the Practically Perfect Forecast (PPH) in filled contours:


.. code-block:: default


    tor_ax,domain,leg_tor = tor_data.plot_tors(dt.datetime(2011,4,27),plotPPH=True,return_ax=True)
    tor_ax

Using TrackDataset
------------------
We can also use TornadoDataset to assess tornadoes associated with tropical cyclones. First off let's get an instance of TrackDataset for the North Atlantic HURDAT2 basin:


.. code-block:: default


    hurdat_atl = tracks.TrackDataset(basin='north_atlantic',source='hurdat',include_btk=False)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    --> Starting to read in HURDAT2 data
    --> Completed reading in HURDAT2 data (7.38 seconds)




This instance of Storm contains several methods that return the storm data back in different data types. The following examples will show how to retrieve 3 different data types.

Now we want to attribute tornadoes from the SPC database to all tropical cyclones which produced tornadoes. We do so using the ``assign_storm_tornadoes()`` method of TrackDataset. The main input parameter is "dist_thresh", which controls the distance from the tropical cyclone center over which to attribute tornadoes to. For this example we'll use 750 kilometers as the threshold.

This code block will take a while to run, as it will iterate over every storm in HURDAT2 and match tornadoes to those that produced them.


.. code-block:: default


    hurdat_atl.assign_storm_tornadoes(dist_thresh=750)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    --> Starting to read in tornado track data
    --> Completed reading in tornado data for 1950-2018 (8.52 seconds)
    --> Starting to assign tornadoes to storms
    --> Completed assigning tornadoes to storm (84.75 seconds)




Once the above block is done running, we can now look at a climatology of tornadoes associated with North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The current method of analysis is via the ``plot_TCtors_rotated()`` method, which rotates tropical cyclones to a storm motion relative framework.

Most tornadoes associated with tropical cyclones occur in the front right quadrant (i.e., forward and right of the storm track). We can visualize this by plotting all tornadoes associated with tropical cyclones in a motion relative framework:


.. code-block:: default


    hurdat_atl.plot_TCtors_rotated('all',return_ax=True)




.. image:: /examples/images/sphx_glr_tracks.tornado_002.png
    :alt: Composite motion-relative tornadoes Min threshold: EF-0 | n=214 storms
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    {'ax': <AxesSubplot:title={'center':'Composite motion-relative tornadoes\nMin threshold: EF-0 | n=214 storms'}, xlabel='Left/Right of Storm Heading (km)', ylabel='Behind/Ahead of Storm Heading (km)'>}



We can also make the same plot for a composite subset of tropical cyclones, given either their IDs (e.g., "AL052004"), or a storm tuple. For instance, let's composite the four hurricanes that made landfall in Florida in 2004:


.. code-block:: default


    hurdat_atl.plot_TCtors_rotated(storms=[('charley',2004),('frances',2004),('ivan',2004),('jeanne',2004)],return_ax=True)




.. image:: /examples/images/sphx_glr_tracks.tornado_003.png
    :alt: Composite motion-relative tornadoes Min threshold: EF-0 | n=4 storms
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    {'ax': <AxesSubplot:title={'center':'Composite motion-relative tornadoes\nMin threshold: EF-0 | n=4 storms'}, xlabel='Left/Right of Storm Heading (km)', ylabel='Behind/Ahead of Storm Heading (km)'>}



Using a Storm object
--------------------

Tropical cyclone tornado analyses can also be done via a Storm object. Let's get the data for Hurricane Ivan from 2004, which produced a major tornado outbreak:

.. warning::

    If you retrieve an instance of a Storm object without first running ``TrackDataset.assign_storm_tornadoes()`` method, doing tornado analyses with a Storm object will require re-downloading the tornado database for each new instance of Storm. If you plan to analyze multiple storms with tornadoes, it is recommended to run ``assign_storm_tornadoes()`` first.


.. code-block:: default


    storm = hurdat_atl.get_storm(('ivan',2004))








Let's plot all the tornado tracks, and daily PPH, associated with Hurricane Ivan:


.. code-block:: default


    storm.plot_tors(plotPPH=True,return_ax=True)
