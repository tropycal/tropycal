        "## Reading In HURTDAT2 Dataset\n\nLet's start with the HURDAT2 dataset by loading it into memory. By default, this reads in the HURDAT dataset from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) website, unless you specify a local file path using either ``atlantic_url`` for the North Atlantic basin on ``pacific_url`` for the East & Central Pacific basin.\n\nHURDAT data is not available for the current year. To include the latest data up through today, the \"include_btk\" flag needs to be set to True, which reads in preliminary best track data from the NHC website. For this example, we'll set this to False.\n\nLet's create an instance of a TrackDataset object, which will store the North Atlantic HURDAT2 dataset in memory. Once we have this we can use its methods for various types of analyses.\n\n"

        "## Historical Tropical Cyclone Analogs\n\nOne popular tool for finding historical tropical cyclone track analogs is via NOAA: https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=4/32/-80\n\nTropycal now has similar functionality, with 4 new analog functions added to `TrackDataset`:\n\n- ``basin.analogs_from_point()`` - Retrieve storms within a radius of a point and their closest approach to the point\n- ``basin.analogs_from_shape()`` - Retrieve storms within a bounded shape provided by a list of lat/lon coordinates\n- ``basin.plot_analogs_from_point()`` - Plot output from analog_from_point()\n- ``basin.plot_analogs_from_shape()`` - Plot output from analog_from_shape()\n\nLet's start out with `analogs_from_point` by looking at all tropical cyclone tracks within 50 kilometers of NYC. For this sample script we'll use kilometers, but if you want to use miles, add a ``units='miles'`` argument.\n\nNote that the first time you run an analog function, if storms in `basin` haven't been interpolated to hourly yet, this will automatically perform that interpolation on the back end, and future calls within the same kernel won't need to re-interpolate making them much faster.\n\n"
