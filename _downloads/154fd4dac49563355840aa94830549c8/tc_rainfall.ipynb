By default, this reads in the HURDAT dataset from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) website, unless you specify a local file path using either ``atlantic_url`` for the North Atlantic basin on ``pacific_url`` for the East & Central Pacific basin.\n\nHURDAT data is not available for the current year. To include the latest data up through today, the \"include_btk\" flag needs to be set to True, which reads in preliminary best track data from the NHC website. For this example, we'll set this to False.\n\nLet's create an instance of a TrackDataset object, which will store the North Atlantic HURDAT2 dataset in memory. Once we have this we can use its methods for various types of analyses.\n\n"

First we'll need to interpolate to a cartesian grid using the ``interpolate_to_grid()`` method, and retrieve an xarray DataArray of the grid and its associated coordinates. Note that the default is to interpolate to a 0.1 degree grid - you can use the ``grid_res`` argument to provide a different resolution.\n\nNext we'll use the ``plot_rain_grid()`` method to plot the output, and provide contour levels for plotting.
